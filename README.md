# Real-time-object-tracker-using-YOLOv8
This project is a real-time object tracking system built using YOLOv8 from Ultralytics and OpenCV. Unlike standard auto-detection pipelines, it allows the user to manually select an object in the first video frame using a bounding box, and then leverages YOLOv8â€™s detection capabilities to track that specific object across subsequent frames.
